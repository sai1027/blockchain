1.	Higher order function and callback function are different.

	Higher order function: 
	Function which takes another function as an arguments is called HOF.

	Callback function:
	Function which gets passed as an argument to another function is called CBF.


2.	Yes. filter is HOF. Filter can take functions as argument.
	
	Eg: 

	let arr=[2,6,8,5,7];
	
	function isEven(num){
		return(num%2==0)
	}

	arr=arr.filter(isEven);
	console.log(arr);


3.	function add(a,b){
	console.log(a+b);
	}

	function cal(x,y,operator){
	return operator(x,y);
	}

	cal(5,2,add);


	Here add is callback function. function cal is HIgher order function.


4.	a) output:
	Hello John
	Hello Tina
	Hello Kale
	Hello Max

	
	b) The higher order function is useFunction()
